/*: Introduction
 
 Hi!
 My name is Giovanni Tjahyamulia
 
 In this playground, I want to tell you about my country
 Especially, the city where I grew up, Palembang
 
 Palembang is not that famous because we are not in Java Island and we are not one of the big city in Indonesia.
 
 But in Indonesia itself, Palembang is famous because our local food, called, Pempek or famous as Empek Empek. Empek-Empek is a Palembang local food made from finely ground fish meat mixed with starch or sago flour, as well as the composition of several other ingredients such as eggs, mashed garlic, flavorings, and salt. And many of my friends in Academy asked me to bring it if the Academy is running offline. I personally recommend that if you want to try, come straight to Palembang, because the taste is not as good as Empek Empek in Palembang.
 
 And the second one is songket cloth. Songket is one of the cultural works from South Sumatra which was designated as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Indonesia in 2013. Songket Palembang is not just an aesthetic body armor cloth but has a great meaning, namely prosperity, glory, and courage. It's not as famous as Batik, but it no less beautiful than Batik.
 
 We also have Limas House. Limas House is a traditional house of South Sumatra Province which is shaped like a pyramid made in a stage style.The Limas House style is like a stilt house, has five levels arranged using the Kekijing philosophy. Each room is arranged based on its occupants, namely age, gender, talent, rank, and dignity.
 
 And then there is Benteng Kuto Besak or Kuto Besak Fortress is a palace building which in the XVIII century became the center of the Palembang Sultanate. The courtyard area in front of Kuto Besak Fortress was arranged to became a plaza by the government. Sometimes this place is used for holding events or festivals with Musi River and Ampera Bridge as the backdrop. At night, the courtyard is filled with night market traders selling various merchandise and local culinary.
 
 And there is also Ampera Bridge. Ampera Bridge is a bridge in Palembang City which has become a symbol of the city. This bridge is located in the center of Palembang city. It's very cool scenery and very iconic in Palembang. But it's more beautiful in the night, when the lights on.
 
 And last but not least is Kemaro Island. In Kemaro Island, there is also a pagoda (Soei Goeat Kiong) which was built around 1839, a large Buddha statue, and a 9-storey 40-meter pagoda which adds to the beauty of Kemaro Island. This island is also often referred as the Island of Love, because in Kemaro Island there is a banyan tree (or called the love tree), if someone writes the name of himself and his partner on the tree of love, their love will last and if you don't have a partner and write name of the person you like, then one day they will become lovers.
 
 I hope this playground can summarize the beauty of Palembang city
